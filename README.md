# Machine-Learning
This Project Contains Example of 2 Machine Learning Algorithms.
 
 1. ALS [Alternative Least Squares] Algorithm using Apache Spark ans Scala.
 2. Naive Bayes Algorithm using Apache Spark ans Scala.

# ALS [Alternative Least Squares] Algorithm
    
    ALS Algorithm Example includes the implementation of Movie Recommendation Engine.
      
      We are using the MovieLens Dataset to Recommend movie.
      User will be Asked for rating 15 movies on the Scale of 0 - 10.
      If User have not seen the movie he can give 0 as Score.
      Output will be the 50 movie Recommended to User.

# Naive Bayes Algorithm
  
    Naive Bayes Algorithm Example includes the Implementation of Tennis Match Prediction.
    
      We are using sample data to train the Algorithm.
      On the Basis of trained data we can give input TO Predict weather match will eb Played or Not.
      The output will be percentage of Possiblity.
      

# We are using Scala version `2.11.8` and Apache Spark version `2.1.0`.
